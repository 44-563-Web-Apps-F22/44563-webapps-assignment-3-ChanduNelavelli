        a member of the spiral-horned antelope tribe Tragelaphini (family Bovidae),
        which also includes the kudu and eland. The nyala is notable for its extreme 
        gender differences (sexual dimorphism) and specialized habitat preferences that
        limit its distribution to the Lowveld of southern Africa.</p>
